1. Project Overview

This project, titled Business Insights 360, leverages Power BI to deliver a comprehensive view of business performance across multiple dimensions—Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive Management.

The dashboard provides actionable insights on key metrics such as:

Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Net Profit

Customer and product profitability

Forecast accuracy and error analysis

Regional and segment-level performance

Channel and division revenue contribution

It enables decision-makers to track business health, compare performance against benchmarks, and identify risk factors like excess inventory (EI) and out-of-stock (OOS) situations.

2. Business Problem

Organizations often struggle with:

Fragmented reporting across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.

Lack of real-time visibility into profitability, forecast accuracy, and market share.

Difficulty identifying top/bottom-performing customers, regions, and products.

High operational costs with limited clarity on cost drivers.

This project addresses these challenges by consolidating data into a single interactive Power BI solution that empowers stakeholders with data-driven decision-making capabilities.

3. Dataset

The project uses business data consolidated from multiple sources:

Sales Transactions Data – Gross Sales, Net Invoice Sales, Discounts, Deductions.

Financial Data – COGS (Manufacturing, Freight, Other Costs), Operational Expenses, Net Profit.

Customer Data – Performance metrics by customer (Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart, Costco, etc.).

Product Data – Net Sales, Gross Margin %, and profitability by product categories (Notebook, Desktop, Peripherals, Accessories, Networking, Storage).

Forecasting Data – Forecast Accuracy %, Net Error, and risk profile (OOS/EI).

Regional Data – Market performance across APAC, EU, LATAM, and NA.

Channel Data – Revenue split by Retailer, Direct, and Distributor.

All financial values are reported in USD (millions), with refresh dates recorded monthly.

4. Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard design and visualization.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating measures, KPIs, and calculated fields.

Power Query (M Language) – For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data preparation.

Excel Integration – Export and cross-verification of data.

Global Database Sources – For system-generated data like Actuals, Forecasts, and Historical data.

5. Project Structure

The dashboard is structured into multiple business views:

Finance View – Profit & Loss (P&L) statements, Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit analysis.

Sales View – Customer performance tracking, profitability and growth matrix.

Marketing View – Product-level insights, top/bottom performers, profitability metrics.

Supply Chain View – Forecast accuracy, net error trends, and risk profiles.

Executive View – Consolidated top-level summary for quick decision-making.

Each view is interconnected, allowing drill-downs by region, segment, category, product, and customer.

6. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data preparation was a crucial step before building the dashboards:

Data Collection & Integration

Pulled system data (Forecast, Actuals, Historical Forecast) from the global database.

Collected non-system data (Targets, Operational Expenses, Market Share) on request.

Data Cleaning Steps

Removed duplicates and invalid records.

Standardized financial values (all in USD, Millions).

Normalized category, region, and customer names to avoid mismatches.

Handled missing values by using business logic (e.g., imputing missing forecast values with historical averages).

Data Transformation

Built calculated fields for Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Net Profit %, and Forecast Accuracy.

Derived KPIs for Top/Bottom Customers, Product Contribution, and Regional Performance.

Created relationships between fact tables (sales, forecast, finance) and dimension tables (customer, product, region).

Data Refresh Strategy

Automated monthly refresh (5th working day of each month).

Ensured historical records remain stable while new data gets appended.
