Power BI – a complete end-to-end dashboard called “Business Insights 360”. This project has been a big part of my learning journey, and with the guidance of Codebasics Power BI classes, I was able to transform raw data into meaningful, interactive, and decision-ready insights.

## Dataset used

📊 What this project is about:

In any business, data flows from multiple dimensions—finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, customers, and products. But unless we consolidate and analyze it properly, it remains just numbers on a sheet. With this dashboard, I aimed to bring all the key business functions under one roof so that decision-makers can have a 360° view of their business performance.

💡 My Learning Experience:

Working on this project taught me that data analytics is not just about building visuals—it’s about problem-solving, storytelling, and decision-making. I learned how to:

✔️ Build efficient data models.
✔️ Write complex DAX measures to calculate KPIs.
✔️ Create interactive dashboards that simplify complexity.
✔️ Present insights in a way that is useful for executives and managers alike.

🌟 The most rewarding part of this journey was realizing how Power BI transforms static numbers into a living, breathing story. Instead of overwhelming stakeholders with spreadsheets, we can now provide them with a dynamic tool to explore insights, track performance, and take informed decisions.

✨ Takeaway :

Data is powerful, but only when we can make it understandable and actionable. With tools like Power BI, analysts are not just working with numbers—they are shaping the strategies of tomorrow.

I’m truly excited to keep building projects like these, keep learning, and keep contributing to the world of analytics and business intelligence.
